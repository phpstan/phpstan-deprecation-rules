This extension emits deprecation warnings on code, which uses properties/functions/methods/classes which are annotated as `@deprecated`.

In case you don't own the code which you want to be considered deprecated, use [PHPStan Stub Files](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/stub-files) to declare deprecations for vendor files like
```
/** @deprecated */
class ThirdPartyClass {}
```

To use this extension, require it in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules
```

If you also install [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) then you're all set!
